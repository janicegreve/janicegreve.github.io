### Hello readers!

*Ava Jones: The End and the Beginning* is out in the world. Reviews and feedback are making me very happy.

I'm now working on the next book in the series.

*Luna's Story: Finding Love.*

Release this year.

I've had a strange few days rewriting a chapter near the end. Only to be woken by the characters during the night with their own opinions. They do that!

So I've been backwards and forwards over two chapters for days.

Today, I started writing the final chapter of the first draft. Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary, so it would be great if I finished it then!

Not sure what difference it makes, just a nice date, if you know what I mean.

Next comes an infinity of time in the editing trenches.

I'll let you know how that's going, once I'm in there!

Take care\
Janice 🫶
