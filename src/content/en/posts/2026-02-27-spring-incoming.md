### Spring incoming! (Hopefully!)

Hi Reader

I don't know about you, but I am so over this winter lark! The garden is green instead of white at last,
so I might start venturing outside again! I've missed walks, bumping into various cats for a quick chat.
Yes, my husband, the Viking, does think I'm quite mad.

One thing hibernating has done, is to give me lots of time to write. Once *Luna's Story: Finding Love*,
had been sent out to the beta readers, I started writing the next *Aalborg Love Story*.
The characters keep on until you do! Usually in the middle of the night!
Plus, if I wasn't awfully busy writing, I might have had to go out in the snow!

Luna's Story is back and I'm busy editing, again. The exciting news is, the front cover reveal!
Sunday March 1st, you will see the front cover, across my social media.
On the same day, on the [Luna's Story book page](https://janicegreve.github.io/en/books/lunas-story), you will be able to see the front cover, spine and read the blurb.
The first time you can get a real sense of the story.

Like Ava's Story, *Ava Jones: The End And The Beginning*, there is a good sprinkling of banter and laughs.
If you haven't read Ava's Story yet, now is the time, before Luna's Story is released.

What can I say about Beth's Story? She's a bit older, not necessarily wiser!
Some of the themes are a bit darker, but I wanted this series of love stories to imitate true life.
Things happen in life, and they are not always nice. There will always be humour and banter,
because whatever life throws at us, we use humour to deal with it.
*Beth's Story: Accepting Love*. (Currently 30,000 words into the first draft!)

I will be announcing the release date for Luna's Story quite soon, so watch out for that.
As always, check out this website for more information and links to my social media and books.

Thank you for joining me on my writing journey, I'm glad of the company!

Wishing you a good start to the spring season.\
Janice xx
