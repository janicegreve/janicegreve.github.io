### Hi

Well January lasted the usual 100+ days. This winter is cold!

It's a good time of year to stay home and hygge! And by hygge, I mean chain myself to my laptop and write!

I've just finished a full edit of *Luna's Story: Finding Love*, and passed it on for its next edit. Always terrifying!

Behind the scenes of my writing, a lot has been going on. My website is under construction, which is super exciting. Newsletter sign up will be available as soon as it goes live.

I have a vision for the book cover for *Luna's Story: Finding Love* - always fun trying to explain what's in your head.

So, that's where we are at the start of February.

Wishing you well and happy reading.\
